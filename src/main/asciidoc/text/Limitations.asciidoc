== Addressing
Within Tigase, all pubsub component address MUST be domain-based address and not a JID style address. This was made to simplify communications structure. Tigase will automatically set component names to `pubsub.domain`, however any messages send to `pubsub@domain` will result in a `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` error.

Pubsub nodes within Tigase can be found as a combination of JID and node where nodes will be identified akin to service discovery. For example, to address a friendly node, use the following structure:
[source,xml]
----
<iq to='pubsub.domain'>
  <query node='friendly node'/>
</iq>
----
