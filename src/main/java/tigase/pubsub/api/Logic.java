/**
 * Class responsible for pubsub logic. We should have at least two of them by
 * default: PubSubDefaultLogic, PepDefaultLogic
 * 
 * It should be possible to add new implementations. It should be possible to
 * stack logic in similar way to UserRepository is stacked, so that for each
 * service jid and maybe for each node we should be able to pick other logic.
 * 
 * If any additional data is need, ie. user roster, instance of class should be
 * passed to classes implementing this interface - maybe new setter methods
 * should be addded to interface
 * 
 * Maybe we should added possibility to add events before/after calling logic
 * methods in classes which call methods? Or maybe implementation of this class
 * should fire this events if thay were added?
